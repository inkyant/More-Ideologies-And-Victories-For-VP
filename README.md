# More Ideologies And Victories For VP
Adds two new Ideologies and Victories to the VP mod for Civilization 5.

## Ideologies
### Prosperity
A new Ideology focused on gaining wealth. 
Good for Economic, Diplomatic, and Science Victories.

### Devotion
A new Ideology focused on religion. 
Good for Religious, Domination, and Culture Victories.

## Victories
### Religious VC
Convert the world (TBD).

### Economic VC
Gain monopolies, gold, and run a process to get to victory.

## Endgame Integration
To better incorporate these new features, there are tweaks to existing game systems.
2 New Wonders and 3 New World Congress proposals have been added.
Order, as an isolationist tree, struggles with Cultural Victory, so it has a new emphasis on Economic Victory, with four of its tenets reworked.
Additionally, a religion rework allows for more interesting religion gameplay for the new Victory.
